# Repository for the personal website 
This repository is intended to store the data behind the personal website [ziheng.io](https://zihengzzh.github.io).

Jekyll is a static site generator so we need Jekyll to build the site before we can view it. There are two commands you can run in the root of your site to build it.
* ```jekyll build``` builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called ```_site```
* ```jekyll serve``` does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at ```http://localhost:4000```
