**Getting to know Damo Academy**

Because of the collaboration programme between XJTLU (my undergraduate university) and Alibaba, I had an opportunity to apply for some internship positions within Alibaba. It was actually the first time for me to know Damo academy, which works on the front-tier technology as a sub-division of Alibaba.

Damo Academy (or Damo) excels at some specific parts of the AI applications, such as Smart City (e.g. traffic analysis), Computer Vision and Machine Translation, the one I will be working at. I did not mean to apply for the MT team, but I was quite impressed with their accomplishments, such as their experimental performance at WMT2018. Hope to know more during the internship.

**Machine Translation**

Machine Translation (MT), especially under the circumstance of e-commerce, is a new area for me to explore. According to Dr. Ge, the MT team at Damo works on several real-world applications that sounds quite interesting. Firstly, their MT translation applications work as communication tools between buyers and sellers of different nationalities. The translation should pay much attention on real-time capability and specific expertise on the selling products. Moreover, similar to the multi-modal framework that I researched on in my dissertation, they also develop applications on the image captioning that helps more intelligent search.
